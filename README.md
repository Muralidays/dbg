Naive de Bruijn graph implementation in python. This is the supporting code for the blog post [http://pmelsted.wordpress.com/2013/11/23/naive-python-implementation-of-a-de-bruijn-graph/](http://pmelsted.wordpress.com/2013/11/23/naive-python-implementation-of-a-de-bruijn-graph/).

A sample fastq file is provided and the code should be run with

`python dbg.py 31 read_1.fq ...`

where 31 is the k-mer size and read_1.fq ... the input FASTQ files.
